This project aims to create an easy to use interface to analyze historical asset price correllations. Users will be able to select from a dropdown to pick various assets and see their performance over time as well as their correlations with eachother. Future iterations of this project will include convexity calculations and rate of return calculations. 

Using the Correlation Calculator, users will be able to:

=Pick two different assets and see graphical representations of their historical performance 
-Switch individual assets piecemeal
-Price graphs for each asset up to date as of EOD the previous business day
-A correlation graph between the two assets' historical performance
