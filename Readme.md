This project aims to create an easy to use interface to analyze historical asset price correllations. Users will be able to select from a dropdown to pick various assets and see their performance over time as well as their correlations with eachother. Future iterations of this project will include convexity calculations and rate of return calculations. 

Using the Correlation Calculator, users will be able to:

=Pick two different assets and see graphical representations of their historical performance 
-Switch individual assets piecemeal
-Price graphs for each asset up to date as of EOD the previous business day
-A correlation graph between the two assets' historical performance 

In addition, this project will include:
-Instructions and a README
-(bonus) APIs to incorporate crypto price data
-(bonus) The ability to hover and see asset prices at a given point in time
-(bonus) Convexity calculations for each asset

Technologies, Libraries, and APIs 
-This project will use the Alphadvantage public API for asset price data 
-This project will use the d3 library for graphics visualization
-In the future, this project will seek to use other public APIs for other asset price data 

Implementation Timeline 
-Friday: Finish d3 rendering of one graph, onboard a second graph if possible
-Monday: Add second graph into presentation
-Tuesday: Do correlation calculations, add third graph 
-Wednesday: Styling, finishing touches 
-Thursday: Bonus features
